      <h1 id="About">WHO IS 10CTY?</h1><hr>
      <p>My name is <b>Teniola Sogbetun</b>, I am a Nigerian from Ijebu-Remo, Ogun State. A western part of Nigeria. I am the only child of the family born in the late 90s, I schooled in Lagos State where i did my primary and secondary school education
         at <b>Silver Fountain College</b>. For my University Education, I studied Biochemistry at <b>Lagos State University</b> in which i graduated in 2020 but officially in 2021 due to COVID. I proceeded for my NYSC in 2021, where i served in Agbara Ogun state.
        <br><br>
        I call myself a creative god lol, yes it is funny and seems like an arrogant statement to say but i see myself as a god because God has blessed me with gifts. Gifts to be able to achieve anything i seek to achieve. I do not like to be normal, I strive to be different from others.
        Apart from education, I am a singer, songwriter and also content creator. <br>
        <br>Additionally, i am a Web3 enthusiast. I work in web3 as a community, collab and partnership manager. I also trade NFTs,Tokens and Invest in Decentralized Finance.
